    <h1>Web Design</h1>
    <p>
      Web designing is the process of planning, conceptualizing, and
      implementing the plan for designing a <br> website in a way that is functional
      and offers a good user experience. User experience is central to the web
      designing process. Websites have an array <br> of elements presented in ways
      that make them easy to navigate. Web designing essentially involves
      working on every attribute of the website that  <br> people interact with, so
      that the website is simple and efficient, allows users to quickly find the
      information they need, and looks visually pleasing. <br>All these factors,
      when combined, decide how well the website is designed.
