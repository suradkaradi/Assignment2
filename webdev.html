    <p>
      Web development is the building and maintenance of websites; it’s the work
      that happens behind <br>the scenes to make a website look great, work fast and
      perform well with a seamless user experience. Web developers, or ‘devs’,
      do this by using a variety <br> of coding languages. The languages they use
      depends on the types of tasks they are preforming and the platforms on
      which they are working.  <br> Web development skills are in high demand
      worldwide and well paid too – making development a great career option. It
      is one of the easiest accessible <br> higher paid fields as you do not need a
      traditional university degree to become qualified. The field of web
      development is generally broken down into front-end <br> (the user-facing side)
      and back-end (the server side). Let’s delve into the details.
